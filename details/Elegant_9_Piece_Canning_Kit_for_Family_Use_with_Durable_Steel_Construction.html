It's made in the US.Mine arrived on time, packaged in recyclable materials.The enamel on both the canner and the colander has no flaws - I examined both carefully since any spots of exposed metal will rust and the surrounding enamel will then start to flake off as well. (I had this problem with my old cheap-brand canner.) No sign of any irregularities in the enamel on either of these items. The jar rack is also good quality.You also get a set of handy tools, for filling and handling jars. I had already bought most of these separately over the years, but these, particularly the jar lifter and lid magnet, are better quality than what I already had.Everything packs up neatly in the canner - I also put in my smaller jar rack, and my older set of tools, and with the colander upside down on top, the lid goes on, and everything is in one kit. I put on a bungee cord hooked on the handles and under the lid handle, and I can carry it in one hand. I can be all set up in just a couple of minutes.I debated with myself as to whether I really needed this set, since the equipment I already had was \"good enough\", but I'm really glad I bought it. Whether you're an experienced canner like me, or just starting out, you need top quality equipment, and the price on this set is great.","purchase_model":"Size: 9 pc Set Color: Speckled Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-09-13 15:45:19"},{"user":"Mink Creek","content":"I considered buying just the canner but decided to purchase the whole set. I am very pleased that I did. All of the elements are of high quality and all are part of making canning easier and safer. Both my mother and my grandmother canned with one of these and now it it my turn. When I retired last year I promised myself I would put food up this summer. It has been 50 years since I canned with my mother and grandmother but with this great black pot it all came back. I cannot promise everyone will remember canning if you get this pot but if you remember someone else canning or if you canned yourself in the past, take it up again. The cost of the pot is easily amortized across the savings on food. I thought perhaps I would just make do with what I had, and I considered buying just the pot but I am very glad I got the whole set. I have used all of the utensils and am very pleased with how sturdy they are. I had worried that they would not hold up to hard use but mine are 60 quarts in and going strong. I have also used the blanching pot to cook beets and for blanching peaches and tomatoes for easy pealing. I also use the blanching pot to keep hot water available to ladle into the big canner when I am processing a long time and the water level is going down. That way I can put hot water into the pot and not stop its boil. I have to give a gold star to the blanching pot. I was weary canning and put my pot on high to start the water boiling and did not put any water in it. When I realized it I thought for sure the pot was a goner. The paint changed color a bit but the pot survived and I turned off everything on the stove and went to take a nap!I have not used the colander but I already had a number of them.This one is nice since it does not have any handles it will fit in a smaller sink which helps with washing and the cold water bath when blanching.","purchase_model":"Size: 12 pc Set Color: Speckled Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-08-11 15:45:19"},{"user":"College mom","content":"I have always wanted to be able to can tomatoes because they are much healthier than store bought ones.I also wanted to use the fresh tomatoes grown in summer months to keep them from wasted.I did a lot of research and settled on this giant pot.I know it\u2019s called a canner, but it\u2019s really just a really big pot!As it turned out, it was JUST what I needed.It holds 9 pint jars and I was able to process 2 batches (18 jars)in just a few hours!The jars are beautiful and I had no problems!This canner came with everything I needed.There an internal rack, which made it feel safer, and several tools; all of which I used.This is the all inclusive package.Beware that the pot is huge, so you\u2019ll need a place to store it AND a big burner on your stove.The website says it is better to use on a gas stove, which is what I have.I not sure about an electric stove, so you may need to look into that if you have one.","purchase_model":"Size: 8 pc Set Color: Speckled Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-07-10 15:45:19"},{"user":"Angie Gerk","content":"I really like my canning Pot and all the utensils that came with it it made it easier for us to can salsa, etcIt was good price for the whole thing thank you so much","purchase_model":"Size: 8 pc Set Color: Speckled Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-26 15:45:19"},{"user":"Dawnella Edwards","content":"Sizing was perfect for all my canning needs it was very sturdy,I haven\u2019t had any problems with it everything worked amazing","purchase_model":"Size: 9 pc Set Color: Speckled Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-03 15:45:19"},{"user":"Kenneth Williams","content":"everything looks great","purchase_model":"Size: 12 pc Set Color: Speckled Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-14 15:45:19"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"I made pepper jelly","purchase_model":"Size: 8 pc Set Color: Speckled Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-09 15:45:19"},{"user":"Barb Faulkner","content":"Our landscaper gave us some Heirloom tomatoes from his garden and I decided to stew some tomatoes and seasonings as a \u201cbase\u201d for spaghetti sauce.I was able to place six (6) Wide Mouth Mason Jars each 32 oz (size) in the pot to boil prior to filling them with stewed tomatoes, of which I had enough to fill four (4) jars.After opening the box the size looked a bit small, but honestly it was perfect and I can use taller jars, depending what I\u2019m canning and they\u2019ll fit just fine.I\u2019m pleased with my purchase.","purchase_model":"Size: 8 pc Set Color: Speckled Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-02 15:45:19"}];
