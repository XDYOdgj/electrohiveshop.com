The lid is so cool, with a built in timer, I may use this lid for other large pans as well as for canning. All of the other pieces are exactly what you would want to use in a canning operation, for a safe, simplified and successful experience. This set would make a great gift for someone who is interested in canning or to pass on knowledge to the next generation. Which was the reason for my purchase. I can watch videos and read recipes, but I learn best with the hands on method. My mom and I have spent priceless time together with this set. I highly recommend it!",

This kit was already well priced and then went on a Black Friday sale, so I took the plunge. The only tool it seemed to be missing was the headspace measure, so I ordered that separately for just a few bucks. I did my first canning of cranberry sauce the day after it arrived and had everything I needed. I\u2019m a big cook and have a lot of very high end cookware. This pot and the tools all seem to be very good quality. I especially appreciate the fact that the funnel is metal and not plastic, which when exposed to heat would most likely leach nasty chemicals into the food. My cranberry sauce canning went smoothly and all the jars sealed as expected. I\u2019m looking forward to making preserves and some other things next summer!PS. The kit came with a bonus gift from the seller\u2014an 8\u201d square metallic cloth.. It had a nice note attached but no explanation of what it was. After asking in my canning group online, it turned out to be a pot scrubber! I can\u2019t imagine needing that for the canner itself as that just gets water boiled in it, but I\u2019m sure it will come in handy on my other pots and pans.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-17 15:45:19"},{"user":"Bren","content":"I can about 500 jars of food per year, and I\u2019ve been canning since I was a girl.My friend recently asked me to teach her daughter how to can so I got this kit for her to learn with me.When we\u2019ve completed a full season of canning, I plan to give her the kit so she can continue the tradition.For the price point and for a beginner, this is a great kit.It basically has most of what you will need to start canning (obviously jars, lids, rings, and processing equipment is not included and would be determined by the product you want to can).However, for the actual processing part, it\u2019s all included.The canner is stainless steel and reinforced on the bottom (much better in my opinion than an enamel canner which is typically sold to a beginner).There is a jar rack which in my opinion will last through several seasons of canning.Personally, I don\u2019t care for timer on the lid.It functions, but I prefer just a regular handle.I like that the lid is clear so you can see your water boil rather than guess or keep opening the canner.The lid is vented which is another positive.As for the tools, I found them to be average quality and will most likely last for some time before needing replaced.I would like to see a stainless steel ladle with a bent hook at the end to prevent it from sliding into the pot while working.I think this would be superior to the one that was included.Additionally, the spatula, which is fine for removing bubbles from the jar when packing food, is functional, but not my favorite.I would prefer one that is more long and narrow and much easier to \u201cde-bubble\u201d the jars with.(I personally have a silicone one that looks like a mayonnaise spatula that works so much easier than this spatula and keeps finger tips from accidentally going into the tall quart jars).Overall, this is a great starter set.The pot is a good quality for the price point, it is easy to clean, and can be used as a stock pot when not used as a canner.It heats up easily and evenly.I noted a few things I would prefer changed, but they are not necessary for a beginner canner.I really think this set is a good value and a savings over purchasing all the components separately.It does come with a small book to help a beginner get started, which is also a great extra.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-23 15:45:19"},{"user":"Jacob J.","content":"This works really well.I love the ease of pulling the jars in and out.Normally I would just super heat whatever was in the jar, seal it up, and then hope for a good seal.But I would always have to heat up whatever is in the jar.This way it doesn\u2019t have to be extremely hot to start.It fits a fair amount of jars and does a great job.Overall I\u2019m very happy for the value for the money.I would definitely recommend it!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-30 15:45:19"},{"user":"Courtland J. Carpenter","content":"I've paid more for a large canning stockpot alone than this whole set and the pot her may be better.I've got the basic tools like the funnel, and the jar lifter.I don't have some others like the spanner, the canning rack or the magnetic lid lifter, and the canning tongs.I've made do without those, but they are all useful.Instead of a roaster (not included here) when making pasta sauce, I use a large slow cooker to dry out the tomatoes. Without a rack I used a steel ribbed platform to keep jars from direct contact with the bottom of the pot.I started canning about 5 years ago, and sometimes it's more work than it's worth, but I like it anyway.I've made jellies and jams, preserves, pickles but mostly pasta and pizza sauces.A good friend gives me a lot of garden-fresh tomatoes enough, so I made two batches of pasta sauce, and two batches of pizza sauce this year.It will be enough to last till next season the total comes to about 30 pints most of them pasta sauce as the pizza sauce is much thicker, so it takes longer.Typical pasta sauce is about 8-12 jars per batch at least for me anyway.Note, for new pasta sauce or jelly and jam makers, this stock pot is for boiling water only.You will use a second pot to boil the sauces in and then ladle it into jars with the included ladle, and canning jar funnel.then the lids and screw tops are put on and tightened slightly. The jars are put on the canning rack and submerged into slightly boiling water in the included stockpot.Air will bubble out and depending on the zone, 30-45 minutes is needed to heat the jars.They are then removed and the spanner used to tighten the screw tops more and left undisturbed overnight.As they cool the air inside will seal the lids and they will have an audible pop when that happens. Properly canned they will be good for two or more years for cannable items.Some non-acidic items cannot be canned this way but require pressure canning to get the temperature higher than boiling to kill the bacteria inside.This is more expensive and can be dangerous, so it's for advanced canners only.This is a basic set with some good quality components, and well worth the cost.Recommended.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-19 15:45:19"},{"user":"Robin M.","content":"I'm a newbie at canning and this canning pot with all it's tools is a great place to start. It really does have everything you need to do a good canning job. The built in timer on the lid only goes to one hour so if you need more like I did today you will have to reset it. The pot is stainless steel and seems very well made. All of the tools are very functional. I'm definitely not a pro at this but this setup is perfect for me right now. I highly recommend this canning pot setup.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-13 15:45:19"},{"user":"Mat E.","content":"This canning starter kit has all the essentials that you need to start canning your own fruits and vegetables.It includes a stainless steel canning pot, a stainless steel canning rack, a stainless steel canning funnel, canning tongs, a jar lifter, a magnetic lid lifter, a canning wrench, a stirrer, a jam spoon, date label stickers, and oven mitts.Having the right tools can make all the difference on how well something turns out and this canning kit definitely simplifies the whole process.This is a quality kit that is well-made, durable and will likely be used for a long time.Happy with this purchase and would recommend.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-18 15:45:19"},{"user":"Anon9998","content":"This kit has been great.I have other canning tools and pots.The tools are mostly a cookie cutter of all my other tools so nothing to exciting there.This pot on the other hand I really like.It is just better than my other pot, bigger and has a nice feel to it.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-20 15:45:19"},{"user":"Maria Lausin","content":"I love this stainless steel canning set! The pan is good quality with a glass lid so you can see if the water is boiling without repeatedly lifting the lid. The basket is normal quality...no issues noted.The gloves are something I didn't know I needed! The silicon coating keeps the boiling water from penetrating the fabric and burning your hands. Dexterity is lost but burns don't happen.The silicon utensils are nice especially since I'm learning certain things shouldn't be handled with metal utensils when canning...The magnetic lid lifter didn't miss any gym days...very strong pull.I love the removable timer and how quiet the alarm is on it, but it's not super reliable.The jar lifter pops apart at the handles too easily. It would be much safer if the handles were one piece all the way across. I intend to use a heavy duty glue to secure them together.I've wanted a metal canning funnel for a long time and this set delivered.The bonus of the roll of labels came in handy with my first canning results from this set.Overall I'm very pleased to have this set. I originally planned on the traditional enamel water bath canner, but this stainless steel one is more durable. It's taller and skinnier so the water level is more easily maintained but at the cost of the space of a quart jar.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-02 15:45:19"},{"user":"JG Yahtzee","content":"This canning pot and set is supplied with everything needed to start canning, and the price is reasonable.I am an avid canner, and this pot is big enough to hold 5 quart jars, which is important.Some smaller or taller pots only fit four jars or less, which makes canning in bulk more difficult and it takes a lot longer.This pot is made of a high grade stainless steel of medium gauge.The three layered bottom should prove to be an excellent feature for heating on the stove, outdoor propane flames, or all types of heat sources.Critical canning utensils such as the stainless steel funnel, the jar lifters, and the stainless canning rack are included!Previously, my cheaper, thinner canning pots started cracking on the pot walls and leaking from the bottom (see photos), and lasted for only a couple years.This pot reviewed seems to be of higher quality, have at least a medium thickness wall, and the triple lined bottom should withstand many more uses than my cheaper thin pots.One can also see my old steel wire rack that has become rusted after years of use, and the corrosion was accelerated around vinegar mixtures.The stainless steel rack in this package should not rust or corrode as easily!This illustrates the point that you get what you paid for, so I must not have paid much for the earlier pots.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-17 15:45:19"},{"user":"audrey k.","content":"This is a really well built beginner set of high quality components. The big pot is thick and solid, with a base that distributes heat evenly. The lid is so cool, with a built in timer, I may use this lid for other large pans as well as for canning. All of the other pieces are exactly what you would want to use in a canning operation, for a safe, simplified and successful experience. This set would make a great gift for someone who is interested in canning or to pass on knowledge to the next generation. Which was the reason for my purchase. I can watch videos and read recipes, but I learn best with the hands on method. My mom and I have spent priceless time together with this set. I highly recommend it!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-12 15:45:19"}];
